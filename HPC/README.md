This event log was collected from System 20 of the high performance cluster at the [Los Alamos National Laboratories](http://www.lanl.gov/). But the link (http://institutes.lanl.gov/data/fdata/) to the original data has been out of date. This log has been used for benchmarking automated log parsers in the following paper, where you may find more details about the usage of this dataset.
